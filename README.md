# looot for Zed

looot gives an AI agent one key and one prepaid balance for 2,500+ data API endpoints from 90+ providers: work emails, phone numbers, company and people search, Google results, web pages, news, LinkedIn profiles, local businesses. The agent sees the price before it runs, and a failed call costs nothing. Top up from $5.

## Install for agents

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http looot https://api.looot.ai/mcp
```

Zed supports remote MCP servers with OAuth natively, so looot needs no extension. Zed's publishing docs also say MCP server extensions are heading toward deprecation in favour of a registry, and that submissions must be tested by hand at the submitted commit. We did not submit one.

## Setup

Settings | AI | MCP Servers | Add Server | Add Remote Server, or edit settings.json:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "looot": {
      "url": "https://api.looot.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

With no Authorization header, Zed starts the standard MCP OAuth flow and opens a browser window to sign in to looot.
